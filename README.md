# The Next web
In this project, we built a responsive website. cloned from a tech-focused magazine which uses media queries to gracefully degrade their site as the window size is reduced.
``We Worked with HTML and CSS.``


## How to test
- Clone the repo
- Run the index.html page
- Check the responsiveness at every breaking point
